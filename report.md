The modal age group affected was 21-30 years (45.2%).

Sixty-nine (44.8%) presented at the hospital directly from the scene of the crash, while 56 (55.2%) were referrals from other facilities. Majority of the patients (71.2%) resided within Blantyre district, had attained primary (48.4%), secondary (33%), tertiary (15.3%) level education and no attend school (3.2%).

| Pedestrian | 21        | 16.8%      |
